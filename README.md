Project Idea: 
I will be using miroarry and miRNA sequencing twoexcel files for this project. Currently, I am using MS-Excel and it is very time consuming to interpret our data. The goal is to export larger files using python program to make easy  visulaization  of these two sequencing data sets. 
Import and INPUT: Two excel files containing Microarray and RNAsequencing data were imported as xls.files.
1. MicroArray
2. miRNASEQ
Descrpition: In the initial some redudent comments and doorstrings commands were used which has been covered in the class. Gradually, I transitioned to Pandas and  matplotlib which used for further  visualization of input and output. 
Outcome for fuuture goal: 
1. The benefit of the product will be downsizing data and reduce calculation time.
2. The data will be more interpretatble  for general visulaization.
